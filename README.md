# CTA Data Analysis - Part 1 
--- 
## Introduction
Hi Cameo ðŸ‘‹ My name is Adam Stueckrath. I'm a highly motivated and passionate engineer who loves data, agile environments, and a strong cup of coffee. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving complex problems and corgis. 

I'm excited to interview with you, and I hope I can bring my skills, enthusiasm, and engergy to your organization. 

## Overview
While working on the technical assessment, I wanted to demostrate a variety of skills that would make me a great Data Analyst at Cameo and add value to the company. I chose to write my analysis in Python and SQL, using Juypter Notebook to explain my work. Being a good data analyst is about telling a story and explaining the steps involved. 

I also wanted to demostrate my ability to use version control (Git) and provide good documentation.

In part 1 of my analysis I developed a simple ETL (extract, transform, load) pipline. I pulled the CTA data through the Socrata API, santized the data, and created a normalized database. Lastly, I loaded the data set into the database tables. Here are the tools I used: 
* Python 3.6.5
* Socrata
* Pandas
* SQLite3

### Part 2 - Visualizations

* Python 3.6.5
* Pandas
* SQLite3
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Folium



## Cameo Technical Assessment
### About:
At Cameo, data analysts start with a variety of production data, which can often be messy. Analysts clean, explore, and transform this production data into useful datasets. Analysts then work with the data to find insights, build dashboards, & run models/projections.

To simulate this we want to work on a dataset with you! Please spend a couple of hours with the following dataset and come prepared to talk about any insights you have discovered. Feel free to use your data analysis tool of choice, at Cameo we primarily use Tableau, SQL, and Excel/Google Sheets.

In addition to the insights you find, please also find the answers to the following questions:
* What is the route with the most stops?
* What is the stop with the most routes?

When you come in, we will spend some time going over what you've found and anything you've built or discovered.
