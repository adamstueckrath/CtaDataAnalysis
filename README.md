### About:
At Cameo, data analysts start with a variety of production data, which can often be messy. Analysts clean, explore, and transform this production data into useful datasets. Analysts then work with the data to find insights, build dashboards, & run models/projections.

To simulate this we want to work on a dataset with you! Please spend a couple of hours with the following dataset and come prepared to talk about any insights you have discovered. Feel free to use your data analysis tool of choice, at Cameo we primarily use Tableau, SQL, and Excel/Google Sheets.

In addition to the insights you find, please also find the answers to the following questions:
* What is the route with the most stops?
* What is the stop with the most routes?

When you come in, we will spend some time going over what you've found and anything you've built or discovered.
