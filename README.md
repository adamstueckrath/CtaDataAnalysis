# CTA Data Analysis
--- 
## Overview
I chose to write my analysis in Python and SQL, using Jupyter Notebook to explain my work. Being a good data analyst is about telling a story and explaining the steps involved. 

I also wanted to demonstrate my ability to use version control (Git) and provide good documentation. 

### Part 1 - ETL

In part 1 of my analysis I developed a simple ETL (extract, transform, load) pipeline. I pulled the CTA data through the Socrata API, sanitized the data, and created a normalized database. Lastly, I loaded the data set into the database tables. Here are the tools I used: 
* Python 3.6.5
* Socrata
* Pandas
* SQLite3

### Part 2 - Visualizations

In part 2 of my analysis I'm going to create visualizations on the data. The analysis will consist of categorical reports and geospatial visualizations. Here are the tools I used: 
* Python 3.6.5
* Pandas
* SQLite3
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Folium
